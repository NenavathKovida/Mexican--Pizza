Mexican Pizza- The Most Loving food.
Crisp pizza shells, refried beans, and a layer of seasoned beef make the “crust,” while pizza sauce, a three-cheese blend, and tomatoes make the topping, creating a delicious love child of Mexican and Italian cuisine.
Mexican Pizzas are delicious corn tortillas topped with beans, beef and all the delicious taco toppings you can imagine! They can be cut into wedges and served as an appetizer or left whole and served as a main dish.
